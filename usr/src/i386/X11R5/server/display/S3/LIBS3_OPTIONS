# There are two versions of the BT485 dac: one supports a maximum
# of 110MHz and the other supports 135MHz bandwidths. The default is 110MHz
# There is no way (atleast not that we know of) to detect the different versions
# But, if the Bt485 on your video card has "Bt485KPJ135" on it, you can
# override the default value by defining 'dac-name=Bt485KPJ135'.
# This will enable you to get more hi-refresh modes, especially if you want
# to run the 1280x1024 mode at >60Hz frequencies.
#
#	1280x1024@60Hz	requires 110 MHz
#	1280x1024@70Hz	requires 126 MHz
#	1280x1024@72Hz	requires 130 MHz
#	1280x1024@74Hz	requires 135 MHz
#
# IF YOU DO NOT HAVE Bt485KPJ135, and if you try this option, you can
