# If you want vt-switching to be snappy, you can reduce the amount of video 
# memory that is saved by the video driver. By default, the driver saves all the
# available video memory (ex: 1MB or 2MB or 4MB). If you use the non-X vt 
# (ex: console) only for text mode, you need to save only 32K and if you use
# the console for DOS/standard_vga graphics programs, you have to save 256K. 
# uncomment one of the next two lines that is applicable to your usage.

# Not all Mach64 cards are created equal! On some of the Mach64 cards, the
# 'blocked VRAM' feature doesn't function properly - this is a hardware 
# limitation; the side effect of using this feature without real hardware support

# From our experience, we found that we cannot rely on the BIOS setting
# for 'blocked write' feature for VRAM configurations. Irrespective of the
# BIOS setting, it works fine on some machines and on others, you will see
# random pixelization problems. We use the default BIOS setting. 
# If you see random pixelization problems on the screen, set this feature to
# "no". To find out the default for your configuration, try 'verbose-startup'
# option. By setting this option to "no", you will see a drop of approximately 
# 40K Xstones in performance! (don't blame us :-) )
# But, on some m/c, even if the BIOS sets this feature to 'unsupported', we
# can force this to "yes" with no side-effects, except for a gain of 40K Xstones
# So, try both and use the "yes" option if you don't have any problems.

#enable-blocked-memory-write=yes

# on some PCI configurations, we noticed that the hardware cursor's doesn't work
# properly on some PCI machines. If you don't see the cursor, use this option
#cursor-type=software-cursor

# If you want startup diagnostics printed out
