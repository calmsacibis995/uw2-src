# If you want vt-switching to be snappy, you can reduce the amount of video 
# memory that is saved by the video driver. By default, the driver saves all the
# available video memory (ex: 1MB or 2MB or 4MB). If you use the non-X vt 
# (ex: console) only for text mode, you need to save only 32K and if you use
# the console for DOS/standard_vga graphics programs, you have to save 256K. 
# uncomment one of the next two lines that is applicable to your usage.
#vt-switch-save-lines=32
#vt-switch-save-lines=256

# if you have a BrookTree RAMDAC that can handle 135MHz, uncomment the next line
# you can go higher than 60Hz at 1280x1024 modes

# On #9GXE64 PRO Vision964 based cards, the memory clock is programmed to
# 57 MHz (least risky frequency). By incresing this frequency, you can get 
# better performance. If your configuration cannot support a particular 
# frequency, you will see drawing problems (pixel droppings) on the screen.
# uncomment one of the 3 lines below.

# On #9GXE64 PCI Vision 864 based cards (problem only on  some configurations)
# 1280x1024 and 1152x900 (except lower refresh rates) modes don't work 
# properly; so, those modes are turned OFF by default for PCI m/c. Uncomment 
# the following line to try 1280x1024 and 1152x900 modes on
# PCI - it may or may not work on your PCI configuration.

# On #9GXE64 PRO Vision 964 based cards, if you experience 'wrap_around' or 
# 'edge duplication'  problems, you can try the following options.
#video-clock-delay=yes

# On some Vision964 based VLB boards, there may be some problems in 
# drawing lengthy solid lines. You can try the following option to
