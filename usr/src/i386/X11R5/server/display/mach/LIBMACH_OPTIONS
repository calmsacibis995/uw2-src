# If you want vt-switching to be snappy, you can reduce the amount of video 
# memory that is saved by the video driver. By default, the driver saves all the
# available video memory (ex: 1MB or 2MB or 4MB). If you use the non-X vt 
# (ex: console) only for text mode, you need to save only 32K and if you use
# the console for DOS/standard_vga graphics programs, you have to save 256K. 
# uncomment one of the next two lines that is applicable to your usage.
#vt-switch-save-lines=32
