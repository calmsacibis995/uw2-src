# if you have a 32-bit Mach32 card and if you have the 'lfb' kernel driver
# installed, the driver auto-detects these two and tries to take advantage
# of linear mapping the video memory. But, in some hardware configurations,
# there might be some conflicts which cannot be auto-detected - this could
# cause random drawing problems (bad icons and other pixelization problems).
# if you experience such problems, first try uncommenting the first line
# (ie: frame-buffer-physical-address=124) and see if it fixes the problem. 
# If you still have problems, put the '#' sign back on the first line and 
# uncomment the second line (ie: use-linear-frame-buffer=no). Don't uncomment 
# both the lines at the same time.

#frame-buffer-physical-address=124
#use-linear-frame-buffer=no
