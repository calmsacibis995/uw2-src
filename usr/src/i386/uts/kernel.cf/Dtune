%% Dynamically Loadable Module (DLM) Parameters
%C Dynamically Loadable Module (DLM) Parameters
These tunable parameters are associated with Dynamically Loadable Module
processing.
% BDEV_RESERVE
The number of empty slots reserved in the
bdevsw,
block device switch,
table
that can be used by a loadable block device driver.
This parameter supports the loadable module feature.
% CDEV_RESERVE
The number of empty slots reserved in the
cdevsw,
character block device switch,
table
that can be used by a loadable block device driver.
This parameter supports the loadable module feature.
% DEF_UNLOAD_DELAY
The global default auto-unload delay time.
Loadable modules will not be auto-unloaded
unless the module is idle for at least the number of seconds
specified for this parameter.
Each loadable module can override
the global default for auto-unload delay
by specifying its own auto-unload delay in the
Mtune
file for the module.
The name of the module's unload delay tunable parameter,
PREFIX_UNLOAD_DELAY,
must begin
with the ``prefix'' field from Master(4) converted to upper case letters.
% FMOD_RESERVE
The number of empty slots reserved in the
fmodsw,
strings modules switch,
table
that can be used by a loadable block device driver.
This parameter supports the loadable module feature.
% VFS_RESERVE
The number of empty slots reserved in the
vfssw,
file systems switch,
table
that can be used by a loadable block device driver.
This parameter supports the loadable module feature.
%% Miscellaneous Parameters
% MAXPMEM
Specifies, if the value is non-zero,
the maximum amount of physical memory the kernel can use.
% NULLPTR
Allows the null pointer workaround to be enabled and disabled.
When the value is 1, null pointer reads are allowed;
when the value if 0, null pointer reads are not allowed.
% USER_RDTSC
When non-zero, then user can use rdtsc instruction, if available.
%% Process Limit Parameters
%%% General Process Limit Parameters
% MAXULWP
Maximum number per user of additional lightweight processes (LWPs)
created explicitly using _lwp_create.
This number does not include the initial LWP that is automatically
a part of every process.
This limit is not enforced for privileged processes, that is,
for those processes with the P_SYSOPS privilege.
%% Timer and Scheduler Parameters
% MAXCLSYSPRI
Maximum global priority used by the
SYS
scheduling class
for scheduling kernel processes.
Changing this parameter changes the range
of priorities used to schedule kernel processes
and can have a significant effect on
the performance of the system.
In general there is no need to change this parameter
unless you add new scheduling classes
or reconfigure the priorities of
other currently configured classes.
The value of
MAXCLSYSPRI
is 100.
%% XENIX Parameters
%C XENIX Parameters
These parameters are associated with the XENIX processing.
% NSCRN
Number of multi-screens for XENIX support.
