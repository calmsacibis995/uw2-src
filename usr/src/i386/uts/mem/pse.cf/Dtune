%% Virtual Memory (VM) Parameters
%%% Page Size Extension Parameters
% PSE_PHYSMEM
Specifies an amount of physical memory to reserve for
use by large shared memory segments.
Setting aside memory for this purpose can provide a performance benefit
to applications that create large shared memory segments
using the shared memory primitives described in shmget(2), shmctl(2),
and shmop(2).
The physical memory is reserved for use in shared memory segments and
cannot be used for anything else,
so PSE_PHYSMEM should be set to 0 unless applications
using large segments (greater than 4MB of memory) are going to be run,
and there is enough memory on the system remaining for other uses.
% PSE_VMEMSIZE
Specifies the amount of device memory that can be mapped by
drivers using page size extension.
Device drivers that map more than 1MB of memory
can obtain a performance benefit.
PSE_VMEMSIZE
can be set by taking all device mappings that are greater than
1MB, rounding each such mapping up to the next 4MB boundary, and
taking the sum of all these roundings.
