.title Help: Enter Serial Number
ABOUT THIS OPTION
Maintenance mode allows you to perform advanced system
administration tasks such as changing the active partition
without rebooting your system.

Do not enter maintenance mode unless explicitly instructed
to do so when reading the Installation Handbook.

ENTERING MAINTENANCE MODE
The UNIX partition that was active at the beginning of the
installation contains an installed UnixWare system.  To
enter maintenance mode you must provide the serial number
for the version of UnixWare currently on your system.
This protects your system from unauthorized access.
