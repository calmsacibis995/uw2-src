ABOUT THIS MENU
This menu allows you to set the block size and decide
whether to limit the number of inodes to 64K for the
current file system.  Typically, the default values are
used.

These options are set on a per-filesystem basis.  To change
the values for another file system type, from the previous
menu move the cursor to the file system type that you want
to change and press <F6> again.

WHAT IS THE FILESYSTEM BLOCK SIZE?
A block consists of a contiguous group of bytes which can be
accessed with a single address.  The block size for a file
system is the number of bytes in each block.

WHAT IS THE 64K INODES LIMIT
A file system is made up of inodes.  Each inode is a file in
the file system.

By default, the maximum number of inodes is 64K.  This is to
maintain compatibility with some older applications (written
for System V Release 3.2 or earlier) without having to
recompile the applications.

If you want to extend the number of inodes of your larger
file systems above 64K, set the 64K Inodes Limit for that
file system to no.
