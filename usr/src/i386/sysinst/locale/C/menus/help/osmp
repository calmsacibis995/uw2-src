.title Help: OS Multiprocessor Support Package
ABOUT THIS PACKAGE
The OS Multiprocessor Support package enables multiple
processes, or multiple threads of execution within a single
process, to run simultaneously on separate processors in a
single system.  This can greatly improve system performance.
(UnixWare is a uniprocessor system until this package is
successfully installed.)

If you select this package you are prompted later in the
installation process for your processor type.
