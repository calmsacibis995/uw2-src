Additional packages, such as the Personal Edition Documentation
and Application Server Documentation packages, provide the books
you can view with the document browser.

See the Installation Handbook for package size considerations
when installing any of these packages.

NOTE:  In a client-server environment, the browser is typically
       installed on the server and access permissions are
       provided for client systems in order to save space.
