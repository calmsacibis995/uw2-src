.title Help: Traditional Manual Pages
ABOUT THIS PACKAGE
The Traditional Manual Pages package provides manual pages (concise
descriptions of UnixWare commands, files, and device drivers) that
can be viewed using the command-line man command.  This package is
designed for users who do not access the graphical desktop.

Desktop users can view the same manual pages, as well as UnixWare
handbooks and guides, by using the DynaText documentation browser:

  To install the browser, install the DynaText Document Browser
  package.

  To install books (including manual pages) that can be viewed
  using the DynaText browser, install the Personal Edition
  Documentation or Application Server Documentation package.
