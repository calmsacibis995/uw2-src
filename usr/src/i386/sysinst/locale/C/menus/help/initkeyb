.title Help: Select Keyboard Type
SELECTING KEYBOARD TYPE
Use the arrow keys to select the appropriate keyboard type; then
press <Enter>.

Typically, your keyboard type and locale are the same.  The
following applies to locales with more than one keyboard type:

   If selecting an Italian keyboard type, select Italian (IBM 142)
   for an IBM 142 keyboard; otherwise, select Italian.

   If selecting a Japanese keyboard type, select Japanese (AX)
   or Japanese (A01), depending on whether you have an AX or A01
   keyboard.
                                   (CONTINUED)

   If selecting a United States keyboard type, select US (Latin-1)
   if you want to generate ASCII and non-ASCII keyboard characters
   (for example, if you want to use special characters such as
   accent characters); select US (ASCII) if you want to generate
   only ASCII keyboard characters.
