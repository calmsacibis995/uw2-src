.title Help: Disk Options
ABOUT THIS OPTION
Select this option to choose whether a surface analysis
of your hard disk is performed or to select whether the
system boot code is overwritten.

WHAT IS A SURFACE ANALYSIS?
A surface analysis is a check for defects in each disk
sector of the active UNIX partition.  If a surface
analysis is performed, the installation software will
use only valid disk sectors.

WHEN SHOULD THE SYSTEM BOOT CODE BE OVERWRITTEN?
Typically you do not need to overwrite the boot code.
However, if your system has an already installed boot
manager for another operating system, you may be unable
to boot UnixWare unless you overwrite the boot code.
