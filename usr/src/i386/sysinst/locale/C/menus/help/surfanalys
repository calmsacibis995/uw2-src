.title Help: Surface Analysis Option
ABOUT THIS OPTION
Select whether a surface analysis of your hard disk(s)
is performed.

WHAT IS A SURFACE ANALYSIS?
A surface analysis checks for defects in each disk
sector of the active UNIX partition.  If a surface
analysis is performed, the installation software will
use only valid disk sectors.

NOTES: A surface analysis removes any data that currently
       resides on the portion of the disk where you are
       installing UnixWare.

       A surface analysis is only performed on disks
       where UnixWare is being installed.
