.title Help: Overwrite Boot Code Option
ABOUT THIS OPTION
Select whether the system boot code should be
overwritten.

NOTE:  If your computer already has a boot manager for
       another operating system, and if you select to
       overwrite the boot code, the existing boot code
       is removed.

WHEN SHOULD THE SYSTEM BOOT CODE BE OVERWRITTEN
Typically you do not need to overwrite the boot code.
However, if your system has an already installed boot
manager for another operating system, you may be unable
to boot UnixWare unless you overwrite the boot code.
