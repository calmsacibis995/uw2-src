.title Help: File Systems -- Size
ABOUT THIS OPTION
Use this option to change the size of a file system.

SIZE
A size is automatically assigned to a file system.  The
size assigned depends on your hard disk's capacity.  You
can change this size by typing over the displayed value.

Most file systems have a minimum and maximum size.  If you
go beyond these limits an error message informs you of the
maximum or minimum value.  In this case the software will
not let you leave the current field until you type a valid
value.
