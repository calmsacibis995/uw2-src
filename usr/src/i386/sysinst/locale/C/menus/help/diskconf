.title Help: View or Change Disk Configuration
ABOUT THIS OPTION
Select the View or Change Disk Configuration option to view
and/or change how the hard disk(s) are partitioned and which
file systems (or slices) are placed in your partitions.

CAUTIONS:  If you delete any partition(s), all the files in
           the deleted partition(s) are destroyed.

           If you change the type or size of a partition,
           all the files in that partition are destroyed.

           Back up your system before changing partitions
           or file systems.

WHAT ARE PARTITIONS?
When you load multiple operating systems on a hard disk,
each one must have its own partition.  (If you think of a
hard disk as a whole pie, a partition can be thought of as
one piece of the pie.)

WHAT ARE FILE SYSTEMS AND SLICES?
File systems and slices further divide a partition into
smaller sections.  This lets you limit the size of
directories; for example, you can limit the size of the
users' home directory.
