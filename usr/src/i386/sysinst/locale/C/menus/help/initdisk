.title Help: Disk Partitions
ABOUT THIS OPTION
Select this option to view and change how your hard disk is 
partitioned.  (An 80 MB active UNIX partition must be selected.)

ABOUT PARTITIONS
Partitioning a hard disk divides it into parts which can be
used for different operating systems.

CAUTIONS:  If you delete any partition(s), all files in the
           deleted partition(s) are destroyed.

           If you change the type, size, or location of a
           partition, all files in that partition are destroyed.

           Back up your system before changing partitions or
           file systems.

USING THIS OPTION
Select a Disk Partition to view/update how your disk is
partitioned.  A menu then displays the disk partition and
includes four fields that you can modify:

       Type       Status       %       Cylinders

TYPE
The following are the choices for the types of partitions:

   UNIX System   pre-5.0DOS   DOS   other   unused   System

UnixWare must be installed on the 'UNIX System' partition type.
If a UNIX System partition is not active, an error message is
generated when you try to install UnixWare and you must either
change the active partition or cancel the installation.

If a system partition is displayed, you should not change its
configuration.  If a system partition is not displayed, do
not create it.

       on your system at the same time, make partition 1 the DOS
       partition.

       field.
