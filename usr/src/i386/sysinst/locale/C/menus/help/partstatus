.title Help: Disk Partitions -- Status
ABOUT THIS MENU
Use this menu to view or change your disk partition.  Disk 1 must
have an active UNIX partition of at least 80 MB.

CAUTION:  If the type, size, or location (Start or End fields) of
          a partition are changed, all the files in that partition
          are destroyed.  Back up your system before changing
          partitions or file systems.

If the disk partition information is correct, press <F10>.

ABOUT THIS FIELD
The Status field on the Disk Partions menu allows you to define
which partition is the active partition.  The active partition
is where UnixWare is installed and is the partition from which
the system boots.
