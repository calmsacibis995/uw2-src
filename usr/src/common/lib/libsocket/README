#ident	"$Header: $"

We make one versions of libsocket, libsocket.so, which uses System V
name-to-address mapping to access either /etc/hosts or domain name service.

The code that was formerly in the resolver directory has been removed.
The DNS code that was in /usr/src/lib/nametoaddr/resolv/libresolv has been
moved to /usr/src/lib/libresolv.  The /usr/src/lib/nametoaddr/resolv/libsocket
directory has been eliminated.  These changes have been made in order to
eliminate redundant code.
