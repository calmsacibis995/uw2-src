libresolv.so	functions for using Domain Name Service.

This version of libresolv.so uses the TLI library rather than
the sockets library to access the Domain Name Service.

The shared library libresolv.so is built by compiling the source
files that used to comprise nametoaddr/resolv/libresolv, then
linking the resulting object files with the shared library libnsl.so
and with libsocket.so.

In earlier releases, libresolv.so was simply linked in the file
system with resolv.so.  Now, resolv.so is built just from resolv.o
and is dynamically linked with libresolv.so, so it is much smaller
than before.  

This change also facilitates the consolidation of duplicate code
in libsocket and nametoaddr/resolv.
