resolv.so	nametoaddr mapping using Domain Name Service.

The shared library resolv.so is dynamically linked by the libnsl netdir
functions when the /etc/netconfig file specifies /usr/lib/resolv.so.
In earlier releases, resolv.so was built by linking resolv.o with
its own copies of libresolv and libsocket object files.  Now,
resolv.so is built just from resolv.o and is dynamically linked with
libresolv.so, so it is much smaller than before.  This change also
facilitates the consolidation of duplicate code in libsocket and
nametoaddr/resolv.
