Hi!

You should have gotten a letter explaining how to make this 
tool.  In case you didn't, just look in the file Theletter.

7/24:

Fixed minor bug in fs_[un]register signatures.

Added automated regression testing.  Now you can say 
"make tests" and watch.

5/23:

Fs now handles the "delete[]" use of the delete operator.

Fs functions can now be (more or less) reliably called 
during static initialization and finalization.  

Several bug fixes.

3/14:

The shell script fsCC is now obsolete.  I've fixed the CC shell 
script (the one contained in the Liberty Corner C++ distribution) 
to understand the -fs option.  To compile and link file with -fs, 
you can now just say

	CC -fs -c foo.c
	CC -o foo foo.o -lfs -l++

You'll only need to use fsCC if your CC shell script doesn't 
understand -fs.

2/90:

Fs does not yet handle the [] use of the C++ delete operator.  (In
the [] use, you can delete an array without having to remember its
size, e.g.,
	int n;
	T *t = new T [n];
	...
	delete [] t; // no longer have to specify array size
This capability may be coming soon to a cfront near you.)

I never got around to implementing the ability to watch for the
creation of a particular object.  If you find yourself wanting to
do that more than twice, drop me a note and I'll implement it.

4/89:

The names of the library functions have changed a bit since AT&T 
Technical Memorandum 59112-890413-TMS.  Also, one or two new 
functions have been added.  Please consult the enclosed manpage 
for the full scoop.
