motifgif and pict - motif .gif file viewing program.


	              motifgif and pict V0.9
	              ----------------------

motifgif and pict are two programs which work together to display a .gif
formatted picture.  You may be familiar with xgif, the father of motifgif.
Motifgif displays a .gif file within motif constructs.  motifgif expects to
find the .gif files in the current directory.


in this directory there are three significant components:


	1. motifgif - the source and executable in this directory
		 which is a motif program driving the display
		 of a .gif picture.

	2. pict - program called by motifgif.  displays a bitmap of a
	          .gif picture file.  this program used to be xgif, but
	          has been converted to motif, hance the name change.

	3. .gif files - files containing the bitmapped displays.


BUGS:

	1. resizing a picture does not work.

	2. -d option is not used when calling pict so remote
	   displays must set the DISPLAY envirionment variable.

If you notice any other bugs in this demo, please see the bug list in
the Release Notes to see if the problem is a known Toolkit defect.
