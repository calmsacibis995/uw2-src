This directory contains the sample UIL/Xm program, uilsymdump.
This program uses the UIL callable interface to compile a source
program.  It also calls the UilDumpSymbolTable routine in order
to show the contents of the symbol table (parse tree).  You
may wish to compile the callable UIL library with the debug flag
for you rcompiler to use uilsymdump to its best advantage.

If you notice any bugs in this demo, please see the bug list in
the Release Notes to see if the problem is a known Toolkit defect.
