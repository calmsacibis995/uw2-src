README for Motif Shell - A shell environment using motif


			       motifshell V0.9
			       -------------

	This directory contains the sources for motifshell.  motifshell
	is a demo of an environment created using motif.  The purpose
	of the demo is to show how motif may be used as an stand-alone
	environment for dispatching other programs and utilities.

	Motifshell is written in C code only.  There are no UIL references.
	The makefile in the current directory should be all you need to 
	compile the program.

	Bugs:

	1)  When you do a directory listing or a ps, you will notice this
	    takes some time.  I use a system () call and pipe the output
	    to a file, and then read the file...I know, not real cool
	    but given the time constraints...hey, it works.

	2)  There may be 'unaligned data access' errors on startup.

	3)  The attempts to execute some other X and unix commands fail
		because the executables can't be found.  This should be easy
		to fix, just haven't looked into it.

	Please let me know of any bugs or misfeatures you find.  If you
	fix or modify the code, please send the source so I can incorporate
	it into future releases.

	If you notice any other bugs in this demo, please see the bug list in
	the Release Notes to see if the problem is a known Toolkit defect.
