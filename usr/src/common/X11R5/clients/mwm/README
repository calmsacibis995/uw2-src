		Mwm 1.2 Snapshot PreFinal Notes (20 Mar 92)


	This is a list of UNSUPPORTED compilation flags used by Mwm:

	   NO_SHAPE - turn off non-rectangular shape extension support 	for
			environments that do not have libXext.a.

	   NO_MULTIBYTE - turn off support for multibyte text and localized
			text.

	   MOTIF_ONE_DOT_ONE - use this flag when compiling Mwm 1.2 against
			a Motif 1.1 Xm Toolkit.  This flag has only been
			touch tested with the NO_MULTIBYTE option also set
			(ie. cc -DMOTIF_ONE_DOT_ONE -DNO_MULTIBYTE).


	This is an list of the changes from Mwm 1.1 to Mwm 1.2.


	GENERAL
	-------

	Performance enhancements:
	    event optimization and focus event compression
	    streamline frequently executed routines
	    fixed unnecessary redraws of icon image
	    fixed memory leaks

	I18n of .mwmrc file

	I18n of mwm's dialog messages

	Builtin default root menu (named DefaultRootMenu)

	Improved support for clients with multiple colormaps

	Improved clientAutoPlace placement algorithm

	Support menu unpost replay so that the unposting buttonDown is
	passed on.

	Support Motif tear-off menus (ie. no truncation of title)

	Support WM_QUERY drag and drop protocol (pre-register mode).

	focus).

	Widget names used by Mwm exposed (ie. TitleName, PushButtonGadget<n>,
	etc).

	Support continuation character '\' in .mwmrc file

	Button1 double click on icons will restore icons to their previous
	window state (ie. maximize window will deiconify to their maximum
	size).

	Alt and Meta key modifiers are treated as different modifiers.

	Posting icon menus via KMenu (now Shift+F10) is fixed

	Allow f.minimize from an icon in an iconbox.

	"Globally active" windows are supported correctly.

	Both "Alt Shift Ctrl<Key>exclam" and "Alt Ctrl<Key>1" will toggle
	behavior.

	Support of non-rectangular SHAPED windows.  Now fully supported and
	documented.


	NEW OR ENHANCED MWM F.FUNCTIONS
	-------------------------------

	Modified "f.lower" function to take 'within' and 'freeFamily' to
	lower transient window below parent.

	Added "f.screen arg" function to traverse screens.  Legal arguments
	are next, prev, last, or a screen number.

	Added "f.restore" function to restore window to previous window
	state.  This function will be be bounded by default to Button1
	double click on root icons.

	Added "f.restore_and_raise" function to restore window to previous
	window state.  This function will be be bounded by default to
	Button1 double click on icons in an iconbox.


	NEW OR IMPROVED RESOURCES
	-------------------------

	Modified "maximumClientSize" resource to take 'vertical' or
	'horizontal' as values (eg. users can specify that Xterms maximize
	only in the vertical direction).

	Added "usePPostion" resource that takes the values (on, off, or
	nonzero) to control whether program specified postion is used or
	not.  The default for this resource is 'nonzero'.

	Added "feedbackGeometry" resource to set the position of the
	move/resize feedback window.  The default is the center of the
	screen.

	Modified "resizeBorderWidth" to default depending on the size and
	resolution of the screen, instead of defaulting to a hardcode '10'.

	Modified "frameBorderWidth" to default depending on the size and
	resolution of the screen, instead of defaulting to a hardcode '5'.

	Modified "iconPlacement" to take the value 'tight' for auto icon
	placement with no gaps between icons.

	Added "moveOpaque" resource to enable opaque window moves.  Now
	fully supported and documented.
