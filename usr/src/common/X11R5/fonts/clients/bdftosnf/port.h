 * The portable font format has the following properties:
 *	little-endian 16 and 32-bit integers
 *	no padding in structures
 *	lowest-addressed byte of a bitmap is leftmost on screen
 *	least-significant bit within a byte of a bitmap is leftmost on screen
 *	bitmaps are padded only to byte boundaries
 *
 * The "native" font format has the following properties:
 *	native-ended 16 and 32-bit integers
 *	padding in structures is that of the compiler with which the converter
 *		is compiled
 *	byte ordering along a scanline is set by a command-line option
 *	bit ordering within a byte of a bitmap is set by a command-line option
 *	bitmaps are padded only to byte boundaries
