XamineYourZerver: An X11 Extension for Server Instrumentation and Tracing

   o  xyztest is a program which exercises the XYZ extension requests.

   o  A server with the XYZ extension properly installed should be
      able to generate output similar to xyztest.output when xyztest
      is run as a client.

   o  Obviously, the server should not crash when xyztest is run, nor
      should xyztest generate Xlib error messages.
