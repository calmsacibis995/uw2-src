For general information about the UnixWare Desktop, refer to the
Desktop User Handbook, the System Owner's Handbook, or the Help_Desk.
For information about system-wide upgrade changes, refer to
/usr/X/adm/README.UW2.0.


Q: The UnixWare Desktop appears to have changed.  What's new?  
A: A new directory, Admin_Tools, has been added to the UnixWare Desktop.
It contains desktop tools which used to be stored under System_Setup
and Utilities.  A separate directory, Admin_Tools/Networking, has been
created for networking related tools.  Tools installed in the
Accessories directory have been moved to the Applications directory.

If you had no personal files or applications in the Accessories,
Utilities, and System_Setup directories, the directories have been removed.
If not, you might want to consider moving your applications to these
new directories.  If you had symbolic links files in their old location,
you will need to recreate the links.

Q: Will graphical applications I installed under UnixWare 1.1 continue to 
work after upgrade?
A: Yes.  They were left untouched by upgrade installation.
Any class database additions made by applications were also copied
into the new class database.  (Your UnixWare 1.1 class database
has been saved under /usr/X/.SAV2.0/classdb for the C locale and
/usr/X/.SAV2.0/locale/<locale_name>/classdb for non-C locales.)

Q: I defined new file classes using the Icon_Setup utility. 
Will my modifications to the class database be preserved?
A: Yes.  Your personal classes have been preserved.

Q: What has happened to my .Xdefaults, .olinitrc, .olsetup and 
.dtfclass files?
A: These files have been changed in UnixWare 2.  Where possible 
(i.e., .Xdefaults, .dtfclass), your customizations have been preserved.
To ensure proper system operation, a few changes were made.
Your UnixWare 1.1 versions of these files have been saved in
your home directory in the directory .SAV2.0.

.Xdefaults: Keyboard and global font customizations have been removed.
Customization of individual keys via the Keyboard preferences sheets
is no longer supported.  The font resources have changed in
UnixWare 2.  You can restore your font customizations with the Font
tool under the Preferences directory.

.dtfclass: The DataFile class in this file has been enhanced.
Any personal classes that you added have been preserved.

.olinitrc: This file has been replaced with the UnixWare 2 version,
with your old version appended (but commented out).

.olsetup: This file has been replaced with the UnixWare 2 version.
Note that the OPENLOOK mode desktop is no longer supported.

Q: Where are Preferences/Keyboard and System_Setup/Terminal_Setup?
A: These features are not supported in UnixWare 2.

Q: Where is the Fingertip Librarian?
A: The Fingertip Librarian has been replaced by the Dynatext Document Browser.
It can be found in the UnixWare Desktop under Applications/Online_Docs.

Q: What happened to my customized color combination?
A: The color property sheet has been improved for UnixWare 2.
There are new pre-defined color-palettes.  Your desktop will
start up with the default color palette.

Q: My UnixWare 1.1 Desktop was in OPENLOOK mode, but after upgrade, it 
comes up in Motif mode. Why?
A: The UnixWare Desktop no longer supports OPENLOOK mode.

Q: Where are my Help notes?
A: UnixWare 2 is significantly different from UnixWare 1.1, so your
notes may no longer be relevant.  Accordingly, the contents of the
Help_Desk have been updated to reflect the new features, so the
locations for your notes are gone.  Your UnixWare 1.1 notes have been
preserved under your home directory in the file
.SAV2.0/dthelp/<locale_name>/notes, where <locale_name> refers to the
name of your locale.

Q: I appear to have lost important customizations to the UnixWare Desktop 
during upgrade.  How can I recover them?
A: Your UnixWare 1.1 files that were replaced or merged with UnixWare 2 
versions during upgrade have been saved under your home directory in 
the directory .SAV2.0.
