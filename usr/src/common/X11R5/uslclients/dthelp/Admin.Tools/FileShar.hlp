File Sharing

Use File Sharing to access files from remote systems as if they were on
your own system, and to set up your system so that other systems can access
your files and folders.

Once you set up file sharing, you do not have to do anything special to use
the remote files. You open remote folders, start remote applications, and
use remote data as if they were local.

You can do the following with File Sharing:

\to\t\k(Access remote share-items^^Accessing Remote Share-Items) from another system 
\to\t\k(Create local share-items^^Creating Local Share-Items) for other systems to use 
\to\t\k(View and modify remote share-item properties^^Viewing and Modifying Remote Share-Item Properties)
\to\t\k(View and modify local share-item properties^^Viewing and Modifying Local Share-Item Properties)
\to\t\k(Unconnect or delete remote share-items^^Unconnecting and Deleting Remote Share-Items) from your system
\to\t\k(Unadvertise or delete local share-items^^Unadvertising and Deleting Local Share-Items) from your system

Soft and Hard Connections

Only use a hard connection if it is essential that the information
you are writing to the remote system not be lost.

A hard connection forces your system to wait for the remote share-item to
be reconnected if a disconnect occurs. Essentially, the system freezes
and is not usable.  However, with a soft connection, if, after a short time
the remote system does not respond, the write fails and your system
becomes usable again. You will have to save your data locally and try to
send it over to the remote system at a later time.
