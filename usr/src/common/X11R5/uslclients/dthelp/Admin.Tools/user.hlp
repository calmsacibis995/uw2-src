User Setup

Use User Setup to add user login \k(accounts^^Types of Accounts) to your system, remove user
accounts from your system, and assign or change \k(permissions^^Understanding Permissions) to user and
\k(group^^User Groups) accounts. 

You can do the following with User Setup:

\to\t\k(View users and groups^^Viewing Users and Groups)
\to\t\k(Add a new user to your system^^Adding a New User)
\to\t\k(Add a new group to your system^^Adding a New Group)
\to\t\k(Delete a user^^Deleting a User)
\to\t\k(Delete a group^^Deleting a Group)
\to\t\k(Assign setup permissions^^Assigning Setup Permissions)
\to\t\k(Change user properties^^Changing User Properties)

Note: Before you begin adding users to your system, you may want to
look at \k(Managing Multiple Users) for some additional information.

Viewing Users and Groups

To view users and groups, do the following:

Note: If you are already in the Admin_Tools folder, go to Step 2.

1.\t\d(Double-click^double-click) on Admin_Tools in the \k("UnixWare Desktop" window^DesktopMgr/desktop.hlp^The UnixWare Desktop Window).
  \tThe "Folder: Admin_Tools" window appears.

2.\tDouble-click on User_Setup. By default, unless you previously changed
  \tthe view, the "User Setup: User Account" window appears. This displays
  \tall of the user login accounts on your system.

3.\tChange the view by clicking on View=>Reserved to see reserved login
  \taccounts, or View=>Groups to display user groups. (To go back to viewing
  \tuser accounts, simply click on View=>User).


^1^Adding a New User
^$30
Adding a New User

Note: You must have system owner \k(permissions^^Understanding Permissions) to be able to
add users.

To add a new user to your system, do the following:

Note: If you are already in the Admin_Tools folder, go to Step 2.

1.\t\d(Double-click^double-click) on Admin_Tools in the \k("UnixWare Desktop" window^DesktopMgr/desktop.hlp^The UnixWare Desktop Window).
  \tThe "Folder: Admin_Tools" window appears.

2.\tDouble-click on User_Setup. The "User Setup" window appears (depending
  \ton which view you last selected, the window displays User Accounts,
  \tGroups, or Reserved Accounts).

3.\tClick on Account=>New. The "User Setup: Add New User Account" window
  \tappears with the following fields:

  \to\tLogin ID: - Type in the name the user enters when logging in
  \t \tto the system. The name should be 14 characters or less. You
  \t \tmay want to ask the user if he or she has a preference for a
  \t \tlogin ID.  

  \to\tType: - Click on either Desktop or Nondesktop. Desktop causes the
  \t \tgraphical user interface (GUI) to start up when the user logs in.
  \t \tNondesktop gives the user the traditional UNIX system shell prompt.

  \to\tManage User Info. via NIS - Appears only if your system is
  \t \tconfigured for \k(NIS^dtadmin/inet.hlp^Accessing NIS).

  \t \tClick on this box if the user is an NIS user. User Setup clears
  \t \tand the following fields are greyed out: Home Folder, Shell,
  \t \tUser ID, Group, and Comments.

  \t \tThe system automatically takes the values for these fields from
  \t \tthe NIS database. 

  \to\tComment: - Add information about the login account name. For example,
  \t \tif the login ID is jmj, you may want to add a comment like
  \t \t"John M. Jones, System Engineer."

  \to\tShow Other Options: - Click on this box to bring up the following
  \t \tadditional fields:

  \t \t-\tHome Folder: - Specify the name of the home directory. If you do
  \t \t \tnot change this field, the system automatically assigns the
  \t \t \t/home/user  directory, where user is the login ID of the user.

  \t \t-\tX-terminal Name: - This option is not available (greyed out) if you
  \t \t \tare setting up a non-Desktop user.  

  \t \t \tIf the user is going to login from another workstation or X terminal
  \t \t \tconnected by a network, type in the name of the X terminal in this
  \t \t \tfield.

  \t \t \tNote: If you do not enter the X terminal name in this field, the
  \t \t \tsystem will prompt the user for the X terminal name each time the
  \t \t \tuser logs in to the Desktop.

  \t \t-\tShell: - Specify the type of UNIX system shell command-line
  \t \t \tinterpreter, such as sh (shell) or ksh (kshell). If you
  \t \t \tdo not know what the shell is, you do not have to change
  \t \t \tthis entry.
  
  \t \t-\tUser ID: - Specify a user ID number (UID). You can use any integer
  \t \t \tover 99 (UIDs from 0-99 are assigned to reserved accounts only).
  \t \t \tIf you do not assign a UID, the system defaults to the next available
  \t \t \t(unique) number above the highest number currently assigned. For
  \t \t \texample, if you assigned UIDs from 100 to 105, the system will
  \t \t \tdefault to 106 for the next UID.
         
  \t \t \tIf you plan to assign users to several machines, it is
  \t \t \tgood practice to give them the same UID number on each system.
  \t \t \tThis is useful with some networking packages.

  \t \t \tNote: For security reasons, the system will not let you choose a
  \t \t \tUID that was previously used and recently deleted. The UID has
  \t \t \tto go through a particular period of time called "aging" before
  \t \t \tyou can reuse it. To override this aging process, see
  \t \t \t\k(Reusing a User Identification Number).

  \t \t-\tGroups: - Choose the group to which you want to assign the user.
  \t \t \tYou might find it convenient to assign group permissions to
  \t \t \tseveral users who have to work together (see \k(User Groups)).
        
  \t \t-\tLocales: - Choose the appropriate locale (for example,
  \t \t \tAmerican English, French, German, and so forth).

  \t \t \tNote: Unlike making a change to Locale in the \k(Preferences^DesktopMgr/locpref.hlp^Changing Locale) folder,
  \t \t \twhich takes effect immediately, changes you make to Locale in
  \t \t \tUser Setup only take effect after the user logs in. For example,
  \t \t \tif you make a change to a user's locale while he or she is on the
  \t \t \tsystem, that user will not see the change until he or she logs out
  \t \t \tand logs back in again.

  \t \t \tIn addition, you cannot make changes to your own locale through
  \t \t \tUser Setup if you are the system owner. Instead, make changes to
  \t \t \tyour locale through \k(Preferences^DesktopMgr/locpref.hlp^Changing Locale).
     
4.\tClick on Add. A pop-up window appears, asking you to confirm that you
  \twant to add the user.

5.\tClick on Yes. The system adds an icon that represents the new account
  \tto the "User Setup" window.

^2^Managing Multiple Users
^$40
Managing Multiple Users

Following are a few things you should know about managing multiple users
on your system:

\to\tEach user has separate access \k(permissions^^Assigning Setup Permissions) to the files he or she
\t \tcreates. A user can protect those files or share them freely.
   
\to\tThe owner account has permission to do all the basic system setup
\t \tavailable on the Desktop.

\to\tThe owner can grant any user permission to do specific system setup
\t \tprocedures, or to have all owner permissions.

\s(Controlling Access to the System and Data^dhelp as sysag "Creating and Managing User Accounts" "Controlling Access to the System and Data" || helpLinkErr)

^2^Types of Accounts
^$50
Types of Accounts

The word "account" refers to a user login. Login accounts on a system
are divided into the following:

\to\tReserved accounts (also called system accounts) - Used for special
\t \tadministrative tasks on the system. For example, \d(root) is a reserved
\t \tlogin account that is used to control the entire system. In some cases,
\t \tyou do not log in directly to a reserved account. The nuucp login, for
\t \tinstance, is only used automatically when remote files are being
\t \ttransferred across a network.

\to\tUser login accounts - Used for the "regular" users on your system.

^2^Reusing a User Identification Number
^$55
Reusing a User Identification Number

To reuse a user identification number (UID) that is still in the "aging"
process (that is, the UID was recently in use and the system is holding
the UID for security reasons), do the following as the root user from the
command line:

1.\tType:

  \tcd /etc/security/ia

2.\tEdit the ageduid file by removing the UID entry.

  \tNote: This is a read only file. If you are using "vi" to edit this file,
  \tyou cannot just use ":wq" to write and quit. You must first write the
  \tfile with an exclamation point (:w!), then enter :q to quit. For more
  \tinformation on using vi, see vi(1M) in the Command Reference.

^1^Adding a New Group
^$60
Adding a New Group

Note: You must have system owner \k(permissions^^Understanding Permissions) to be able to
add groups.

To add a new group to your system, do the following:

Note: If you are already in the Admin_Tools folder, go to Step 2.

1.\t\d(Double-click^double-click) on Admin_Tools in the \k("UnixWare Desktop" window^DesktopMgr/desktop.hlp^The UnixWare Desktop Window).
  \tThe "Folder: Admin_Tools" window appears.

2.\tDouble-click on User_Setup. The "User Setup" window appears (depending
  \ton which view you last selected, the window displays User Accounts,
  \tGroups, or Reserved Accounts).

3.\tClick on Group=>New. The "User Setup: Add New Group" window appears
  \twith the following fields:

  \to\tGroup Name: - Type in the name of the new group.

  \to\tManage Group Info. via NIS - Appears only if your system is
  \t \tconfigured for \k(NIS^dtadmin/inet.hlp^Accessing NIS).

  \t \tClick on this box if the group is an NIS group. User Setup clears
  \t \tand the Group ID field is greyed out.

  \t \tThe system automatically takes the value for Group ID from
  \t \tthe NIS database. 

  \to\tGroup ID number: - Type in the group ID number. If you do not
  \t \tassign a group number, the system defaults to the next available
  \t \tgroup number.

4.\tClick on Add. A pop-up confirmation window appears.

5.\tClick on Yes to add the group (or No if you change your mind and
  \tdecide not to add the group).

^2^User Groups
^$70
User Groups

You can assign several users to a group. This allows you to set access
\k(permissions^^Understanding Permissions) so certain files, folders, and applications are available
only to a specific group of users.

For example, you may have three people working together on the same
project, and you could assign those people to a group called "Project 1."
As those three people create files relating to the project, they can
open group permission so that the files are accessible only to the people
in the group Project1.

See \k(Adding a New Group) for the procedure on how to add a new group
to the system.

^2^Understanding Permissions
^$100
Understanding Permissions

When you install the Desktop on your computer, the system asks you to
add a user account that is assigned as the "owner" of the system.
The owner has special privileges to do administrative tasks that you
may not want to be available to everyone. For example, if you are
the owner you may not want everyone who uses your system to add other
users or to change the configuration of your printers or networks.

As the owner, you can assign owner permissions to any other
user (see \k(Assigning Setup Permissions)). You can either assign
full ownership privileges, or privileges to do specific tasks only.

Full ownership allows you to do all the tasks described below, as well as
add and delete users and assign task permissions. Specific ownership
permissions include the following:

\to\tShutdown System - Enables you to shut down the operating
\t \tsystem using \k(Shutdown^DesktopMgr/shutdown.hlp^Shutting Down Your System).

\t \tThis operation is restricted because you would not want any user to
\t \tshut down the system arbitrarily. You probably do not want to give
\t \tpermission for this function to other users.

\to\tAccess Disks, Tapes, etc. - Enables you to read and write information
\t \tfrom any disk, tape, or other icons in the \k(Disks-etc^dtadmin/disk.hlp^Overview of the Disks-etc Folder) folder.
\t \tBy default, all users have permission to access disks and tapes. 

\to\tAccess Remote Systems - Enables you to remotely log in and transfer
\t \tfiles to and from remote systems. These features are available from
\t \tany remote system icon installed through \k(Dialup Setup^dtadmin/DialMgr.hlp^Dialup Setup) or
\t \t\k(Internet Setup^dtadmin/inet.hlp^Internet Setup). The system gives this privilege to all users by default.

\to\tChange Dialup Setup - Enables you to add or change modem or direct
\t \tconnection configurations on your computer from the \k(Dialup Setup^dtadmin/DialMgr.hlp^Dialup Setup)
\t \tfolder.

\t \tThis feature also lets you define the systems that you can
\t \treach over those connections. Typically, these configurations rarely
\t \tchange, so permissions to change them should be restricted.

\to\tChange Internet Setup - Enables you to add systems to the list of those
\t \tyou can reach over an Ethernet connection (through \k(Internet Setup^dtadmin/inet.hlp^Internet Setup)).

\t \tBecause improperly assigned system names and addresses can cause
\t \tproblems within a network, you should restrict this privilege.

\to\tAdminister Printers - Enables you to change printer configuration
\t \tinformation using \k(Printer Setup^dtadmin/Printer_Setup.hlp^Printer Setup).

\t \tPrinter information includes the printer type and how it connects
\t \tto your system. Because you usually do not need to change your
\t \tprinter setup after you initially install and configure a printer,
\t \tother users do not really need Administer Printer permission.

\to\tAdd/Remove Fonts - Enables you to add and remove fonts from
\t \t\k(Font Setup^dtadmin/fontmgr.hlp^Fonts).  Because an application will fail if it
\t \tneeds a font that is not there or that is improperly installed, you
\t \tshould restrict permission to this privilege.

\to\tAdd/Remove Applications - Enables you to install and remove
\t \tapplication packages on the system from the \k(Application Installer^dtadmin/App_Installer.hlp^Application Installer) folder.
 \t \tYou should restrict this privilege to control the types of applications
 \t \tinstalled on your system.

\to\tAdvertise Local Folders/Files - Enables you to advertise local
\t \t\d(share-items^share-item) using \k(File Sharing^dtadmin/FileShar.hlp^File Sharing).

\t \tBecause this opens access to your computer from remote systems, you
\t \tshould restrict this privilege.

\to\tConnect to Remote Folders/Files - Enables you to connect to remote
\t \t\d(share-items^share-item) using \k(File Sharing^dtadmin/FileShar.hlp^File Sharing).

 \t \tThis privilege lets users access files from remote systems. If you
\t \twant to control the flow of information to your computer, restrict
\t \tthis privilege.

\to\tAdminister UnixWare Mail - Enables you to make changes to the
\t \t\k(UnixWare Mail Setup^Mail_Setup/Mail_Setup.hlp^Mail Setup).
    
\to\tAdminister the MHS Gateway - Enables you to make changes to the
\t \t\k(Message Handling Service^MHS_Setup/MHS_Setup.hlp^MHS Setup).

\to\tAccess NetWare Setup - Enables you to set up \k(NetWare^NetWare_Setup/NetWare_Setup.hlp^NetWare Setup).

\to\tShare Applications - Enables you to advertise, or share, applications
\t \ton your system with remote systems through \k(Application Sharing^App_Sharing/applsharing.hlp^Application Sharing).

\to\tAccess Install Server - Enables you to install UnixWare products,
\t \tor packages, across a NetWare network using \k(Install Server^Install_Server/Install_Server.hlp^Install Server).

\to\tStart and Stop Processors - Enables you to perform multiprocessing
\t \tsetup functions, such as taking a processor online or offline,
\t \tusing \k(Processor Setup^dtadmin/multiproc.hlp^Processor Setup).

Note: The root login is the traditional UNIX system login for all system
administration tasks. For more information, see \k(The root Login).

The root Login

The root login is the traditional UNIX system login for all system
administration tasks. Most basic procedures formerly available only to
users logged in as root can now be done by the system owner (see
\k(Understanding Permissions)).

If you prefer, you can log in to the system from a \k(Terminal^xterm/term.hlp^Terminal) window and perform the
administrative tasks using UNIX system commands and files. For detailed
information on working from the UNIX system command line interface,
