#ident	"@(#)dthelp:dtaudit/README	1.2"

This directory contains software tools to audit help files intended for
use with the graphical interface in SVR4.2 and later releases.

The tools checks for the following:
	- links to nonexistent sections.

To audit an entire "help" directory hierarchy, use the "dtaudit" shell
script.  You may specify the root of the help hierarchy as an argument
to dtaudit; it defaults to "/usr/X/lib/locale/C/help".  You may also
specify the name of the output file which will contain the result of
the audit; the default output file is "dtaudit.out".

dtaudit will create a file called "hlp.files" which will be passed to
another tool (Match) as input.

	Usage: dtaudit [-d <directory>] [-o <output_file>]

The tool "Match" invokes Refs and Tags to verify that every reference
(a hypertext link) points to an existent section.  This is done for every
file in the input file.

	Usage: Match input_file

where input_file can be a basename or a full path name.

Each line that is checked will be written to the standard output.  All
errors and warings that are detected are flagged by appending the string
"- ERROR -" or "-WARNING-" to the line, respectively.

Note that you may invoke Match without using dtaudit.  To audit a selected
set of help files, create a list of the files to be audited (as a set) in
a file and execute Match with that file as its input.

Examples:

		"Match infile | grep ERROR > outfile"

		"Match infile | grep WARNING > outfile"

To build this software type "make".  This will create the three
executables: Match, Tags, Refs.  Note that the path where these
executables reside should be included in your PATH environment
variable.  (Ex: PATH=$PATH:/home/user/dtaudit export PATH)

Note that duplicate sections are currently not being detected.  This will
be done as an enhancement in the near future.
