This Directory Supports the following three sets of configurations:
   1) Error Message Localization
   2) Interface Localization
   3) Character Set Localization
================================
================================
================================

1) Error Message Localization
================================

The file 'errors.txt' is a list of error numbers and their corresponding
string message.  The print style formatting directives are replaced with
associated values.
This file can be modified as you wish. 
If an EBT program cannot find a message in the file, its number
is printed out instead.

The file 'msgs.txt' is a list of dialog box messages used in the system.

props.txt: style property names

values.txt: style property values

query.txt: query language keywords
================================
================================
================================

2) Interface Localization (dtext,insted directories)
================================ 

The interface can be localized by using a set of files found in the
dtext directory with the .rc extension.
See the System Adminstration manual for the 
names and grammars for these file.

3) Character Set Localization

================================

This directory can have the following files to support
extended character sets and multiple languages.
=============================================================

upper.x: translation table to convert characters to uppercase
lower.x: translation table to convert characters to lowercase

global.i: global isa table
	UPPER: 1 bit
        LOWER: 2 bit
	PUNCT: 4 bit
	SPACE: 8 bit
	DIGIT: 16 bit
	CONTROL: 32 bit

mac-8859.x: mac to 8859 translation table, etc.


Format of a translation table file
=============================================================
# this line is a comment
# any line can also be blank
#name Name of table, such as mac-iso8859 (translate from mac to 8859)

# this next line shows the entry for hex 0x10 in the table with a value of 
# hex 0x40
# NOTE: The table maps the first --> second.  In this case, 0x10 maps
# to 0x40.

0x10 0x40

# this next line shows the same thing but using decimal notation
16 64

# this next line shows the same thing using character notation
'a' 'A'

# note that formats can be mixed as shown on this next line
'a' 0x62

# you should have one line such as that above for every entry
# that has to be translated

# if a character does not have an entry, its translation is
# defined to be the same, in other words, its translation is
# mapped to itself



Format of an isa table file
=============================================================
#name Name of table
# this line is a comment
# any line can also be blank

# by default, the table will begin empty
# by default, the table will being with bits set to 0

#bits number
# where number is an integer between 0 and 255
# first this turns everything off for bits number
# then add all following entries setting bits number
 
# this next line adds hex characters 0x10 and 0x20 to the table
# under the current bit settings
0x10 0x20

# this next line adds the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' to the table
'a' 'b' 'c'

# this line adds decimal character 5 to the table
5
