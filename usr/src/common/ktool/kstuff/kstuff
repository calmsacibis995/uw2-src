# kstuff: Command to stuff a kernel onto a remote machine via rcp/rsh.
#
#	The default targets of this activity on the remote machine are:
#	
#		config tree:	/etc/conf.unix.<login-id>
#		kernel:		/stand/unix.<login-id>
#	
#	This command supports both interactive and batch modes.
#	
#	In interactive mode, the user selects among pre-build bundles, and
#	kernel trees from which bundles can be built.
#	
#	In batch mode, $ROOT/$MACH is used to select a kernel.
