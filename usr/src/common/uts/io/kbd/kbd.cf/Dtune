%% Keyboard mapping (KBD) Parameters
%C Keyboard mapping (KBD) Parameters
These tunable parameters are associated with keyboard mapping.
% KBDTIME	
Specifies the default timer value for timeout mode.
It is the number of clock ticks allowed before timing out.
The value of one clock tick depends on the hardware, but is usually
1/100 of a second. 
A timeout value of 20 is 1/5 second at 100Hz.
Values from 5 to 400 inclusive are allowed by the module; if the value
set for KBDTIME is outside this range, the module forces it to
the nearest limit.
This value is a default;
users can change their specific stream to use a different
value depending on their own 
preferences, terminal baud-rate, and typing speed.
% NKBDU
Specifies the maximum number of tables that can be attached by
a single user.
The number should be large enough to cover uncommon cases, and
must be at least 2.
% ZUMEM
Specifies the maximum number of bytes that a user,
other than a privileged user,
can allocate for private tables (that is, the quota).
Default is 4096.
