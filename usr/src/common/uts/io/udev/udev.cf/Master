# This pseudo-device handles dynamic device number allocation.
# Dynamic device numbers are used for pseudo-filesystems and for
# compatibility aliases for older non-EFT applications.
#
# Increase the range of major numbers (last two fields) to allow
# for more dynamic device numbers; each major number supports 256
# device numbers.  The major number range must also be changed in
# /etc/conf/cf.d/res_major
