%% STREAMS Parameters
% LOGHIWAT
The high water mark (in bytes) for the long driver.
High and low water marks are used by STREAMS for
flow control.
When debugging modules and drivers,
strace (1M)
can be used.
If the messages are generated too quickly,
strace
may lose some of them.
Setting these
values allows you to control the amount of data that
flows through the driver to prevent messages from being lost.
% LOGLOWAT
The low water mark (in bytes) for the log driver.
See
LOGHIWAT
for more information.
