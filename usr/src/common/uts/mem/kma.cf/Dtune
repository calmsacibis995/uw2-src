%% Kernel Memory Allocator (KMA) Parameters
% KMA_PAGEOUT_POOL
Controls the size of a chunk of memory which is dedicated for use
by the kernel memory allocator while executing in the pageout LWP.
It is the number of bytes reserved for pageout daemon (includes overhead).
The purpose is to allow pageout operations that might otherwise
be blocked waiting for memory to proceed, thereby avoiding deadlock.
This value should only be increased if a system hang is observed,
and analysis of the kernel's behavior
(for example using kdb or crash)
shows that a pageout deadlock was responsible.
% KMAGBTIME
Specifies the number of seconds between giveback runs.
This is also known as the kernel memory allocator's giveback interval.
This tunable specifies how much time there is between successive attempts
by the kernel memory allocator to give back unused memory (for possible use by
processes or file systems).
Increasing this value increases the kernel allocator's requirement for memory.
Decreasing it increases the CPU usage of the giveback attempts.
