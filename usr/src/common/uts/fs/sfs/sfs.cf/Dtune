%% File System Parameters
%C File System Parameters
These tunable parameters include Generic File System parameters,
as well as those for the Buffer Cache, DOSFS File System,
FIFO File System, MEMFS File System,
NAMEFS File System, NFS File System, SFS File System,
S5 File System, UFS File System, VXFS File System,
and the XENIX File System.
%%% SFS Filesystem Parameters
% SFSFLUSH
Specifies how often the fsflush daemon
writes sfs inode data out to disk on sfs file systems.
A smaller value causes the daemon to run more often,
making the file system ``harder,'' that is,
less likely to lose data in a crash.
However, it does take some
CPU
time.
% SFSINODELWM
Specifies the minimum number of inodes to keep in the dynamically
allocated inode pool.
This keeps the system from returning space to the KMA (Kernel Memory
Allocator) when it is likely to need it back in the inode pool
relatively quickly.
% SFSTIMELAG
An heuristic to not reuse inodes sooner than the specified number of ticks,
if possible.
% SFSNINODE
Specifies 
the maximum number of inode entries in the sfs inode table
when 
an sfs file is configured in your system.
An sfs inode is a data structure
that typically describes a file, directory,
link and named pipe in an sfs file system type.
Too few incore inodes causes:

a poor buffer cache read/hit ratio (obtained with sar -b)

a higher percentage of inodes with pages recycled or
percent ipf (obtained with sar -t)

a poor page attach rate (obtained with sar -p)

This tunable is automatically adjusted based on memory size,
but you can override the autotuned value by using
idtune.
%%% UFS File System Parameters
% NDQUOT
The size of the kernel quota table for the
ufs
file system.
There is one entry for each user.
Thus
NDQUOT
should be more than the maximum number of users
that can be logged onto the system if a
ufs
or
sfs
file system type is being used.
If quotas are in effect,
the table entries limit the amount of
disk space a user can use.
If there are no available entries, the message
``dquot table full''
is printed on the console.
If this occurs, the value of
NDQUOT
should be increased.
