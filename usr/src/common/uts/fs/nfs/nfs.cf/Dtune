%% File System Parameters
%%% NFS File System Parameters
% NFS_ASYNC_MAX
Specifies the maximum number of lightweight processes (LWPs)
that can be created for asynchronous I/O over NFS.
The default value of 8 LWPs is expected to be sufficient for most systems.
% NFS_ASYNC_TIMEOUT
Specifies, in seconds,
the time-to-live of the lightweight processes (LWPs)
that do asynchronous I/O over NFS.
If an asynchronous request
is not generated in the system in NFS_ASYNC_TIMEOUT seconds,
the LWPs exit.
% NFS_MAXCLIENTS
Specifies the number of active RPC client handles that NFS can cache.
The default is 6 clients.
Increase this number
only when more memory is added to the system.
% NFS_MMAP_TIMEOUT
Specifies, in seconds,
the interval between the time the NFS mmap lightweight process (LWP) wakes up
and the time the NFS mmap LWP updates
file attributes for ll mmaped files.
The default is 30 seconds.
Given the large amount of CPU time the mmap LWP can potentially consume,
in cases where a significant number of files have been mmaped over NFS,
this value should not be made too small.
The minimum value is 30 and the maximum, 180.
% NFS_NRA
Specifies the number of pages to read ahead for each read operation,
if possible.
The default is 1 page.
Read-ahead over NFS may be turned off by changing this value to 0.
% NFS_RETRIES
Specifies the maximum number of NFS retries before failing the
NFS operation for a soft mount.
The default is 5 retries.
Typically, this value should not be changed.
% NFS_TIMEO
Specifies, in seconds,
the maximum initial time to wait for an NFS server
to respond to a client request.
The default is 10 seconds.
On machines connected to ``lossy'' networks
(networks where packets tend to get lost),
this value should be changed.
On some ``lossy'' networks you will have greater success
getting the packet if you retry earlier;
on other networks, you will have greater success if you wait longer.
% NFSD_MAX
Specifies the maximum number of lightweight processes (LWPs)
that can be created for servicing NFS requests from clients.
The default is 8 LWPs.
Increase this value for dedicated NFS servers.
% NFSD_MIN
Specifies the minimum number of lightweight processes (LWPs)
that should always exist in the system for servicing NFS requests
from NFS clients.
The default is 2 LWPs.
Increase this value for dedicated NFS servers.
% NFSD_TIMEOUT
Specifies, in seconds,
the time-to-live of the lightweight processes (LWPs)
that service NFS requests from clients.
If an NFS request is not received by the system in NFSD_TIMEOUT seconds,
the LWPs exit.
The default is 8 seconds.
% NRNODE
Specifies the maximum number of rnode structures
to be allocated for NFS.
An rnode is a node specific to the NFS file system type.
