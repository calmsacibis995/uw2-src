%% File System Parameters
%%% S5 File System Parameters
% S5FSFLUSH
Specifies how often the fsflush daemon
writes s5 inode data out to disk on S5 file systems.
A smaller value causes the daemon to run more often,
making the file system ``harder,'' that is,
less likely to lose data in a crash.
However, it does take some
CPU
time.
% S5INODELWM
Specifies the minimum number of inodes to keep in the dynamically
allocated inode pool, the low water mark (LWM).
This keeps the system from returning space to the KMA (Kernel Memory
Allocator) when it is likely to need it back in the inode pool
relatively quickly.
