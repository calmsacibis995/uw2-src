The SPX TLI test tsolo tests the TLI interface locally (not over the net).
 
The usage is:

	tsolo [/r#] [/p#] [/v] [[/b#] | [/s#] [#] ...]

	r = repeat # times

	p = protocol	1	= spx
					2	= ipx
					-1	= ipx and spx

	v = verbose

	b = start tests at #

	s +#  = use verbose on #
	s -#  = do not use verbose on #
	note:	the tests are run in order on the command line	
			verbose is default if no - is present 
			/v has no effect when /s is present
			/b has no effect when /s is present
			the

	example:
			tsolo /r5 /s-1 -8 +5	repeat tests 1,8,5 five times, with
									test 5 in verbose mode.
			
			tsolo /r5 /p1 /v /b4	repeat tests starting at test 4
									five times with spx protocol. All
									in verbose mode.

The SPX TLI test tsrvr tests the TLI interface against 
	another over the net.

The usage is:

	tserver [/r#] [/p#] [/v] [[/b#] | [/s#] [#] ...] /nxxxxxxxx yyyyyyyy

	r = repeat # times

	p = protocol	1	= spx
					2	= ipx
					-1	= ipx and spx

	v = verbose

	b = start tests at #

	n	xxxxxxxx =  first network number

		yyyyyyyy = 	second network number
	


The SPX TLI test tclnt tests the TLI interface against 
	another over the net.

The usage is:

	tclient [/r#] [/p#] [/v] [[/b#] | [/s#] [#] ...] /nxxxxxxxx yyyyyyyy

	r = repeat # times

	p = protocol	1	= spx
					2	= ipx
					-1	= ipx and spx

	v = verbose

	b = start tests at #

	n	xxxxxxxx =  first network number

		yyyyyyyy = 	second network number
