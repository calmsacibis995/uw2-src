Very basic way to get started.


On platform 1
	load_d -v (verbose) -I (use ipx transport)
This is the receiving node.


On platform 2
	load -v (verbose) -I (use ipx transport) \
		-a ???????? (ipx net address in hex of platform 1) \
		-n ????????????  (ipx node address in hex of platform 1)
This is the sending node.

Remove the -I to run over SPX

Use -? to see additional options
