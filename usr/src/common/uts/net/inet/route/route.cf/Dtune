%% Networking Parameters
%C Networking Parameters
These tunable parameters include those for General Networking,
as well as for the
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP),
Asynchronous High Level Datalink Control (ASYH),
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP),
Internet Protocol (IP),
Packet Routing,
Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP),
Remote Procedure Call (RPC),
Transport Control Protocol (TCP),
and User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
%%% Packet Routing Parameters
% RTSUBNETSARELOCAL
Typically, the Internet Protocol
limits the size of packets sent through a gateway
to 576 bytes (as per RFC 1122).
If RTSUBNETSARELOCAL is nonzero,
this restriction is not applied
to destinations that are on non-connected subnets of a network
to which the machine is connected.
In other words,
this assumes that any gateway
to a subnet of a connected network can handle large packets.
This parameter should be tuned on in a configuration in
which all subnets are connected
by high-bandwidth gateways and media
(such as several Ethernets connected by routers).
