%% Networking Parameters
%%% Internet Protocol (IP) Parameters
% IPCKSUM
Controls whether IP (Internet Protocol) checksumming is enabled.
By default, IP checksumming is turned on (set to 1).
Except when the underlying hardware
guarantees correct and uncorrupted delivery of all packets,
this parameter should remain turned on.
% IPFORWARDING
If IPFORWARDING is set, hosts will act as gateways.
Controls whether ip will forward packets;
that is, whether it will act as a gateway.
This parameter should be turned on (set to 1)
only if the machine is intended to be a gateway.
% IPSENDREDIRECTS
Controls whether ip will generate ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
redirect messages
when forwarding packets to a destination
that the sender should be able to reach directly.
This should be turned on (set to 1)
only if needed to support diskless workstations,
or if the machine is acting as a router or gateway.
