%% Networking Parameters
%%% Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Parameters
% ICMPMASKREQ
Controls whether icmp will respond to subnet mask requests.
By default, this is turned off (set to zero).
When turned on (set to one),
the system responds to subnet mask requests
using the subnet mask for the interface
the request was received on.
This parameter should be turned on
when a system will supply subnet mask information
to another system (for example, to a diskless workstation).
Otherwise it should remain turned off.
