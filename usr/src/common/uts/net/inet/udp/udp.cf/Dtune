%% Networking Parameters
%%% User Datagram Protocol (UDP) Parameters
% UDPCKSUM
Specifies whether udp checksum computation and verification is enabled.
Set to one to enable udp checksum computation and verification.
Checksum computation should be enabled for systems running NFS.
The default is not to checksum.
% UDPTTL
Specifies the time-to-live value requested by udp
(see TCPTTL).
The default of 30 should be satisfactory,
but it will need to be increased
if connections are made to machines
that are more than 30 hops away.
