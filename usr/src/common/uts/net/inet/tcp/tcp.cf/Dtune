%% Networking Parameters
%%% Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Parameters
% TCPTTL
Specifies the IP (Internet Protocol) time-to-live value
requested by tcp
(this is, 
the maximum number of intermediate hops a packet can go through).
The default of 64 should be satisfactory,
but it will need to be increased
if connections are made to machines
that are more than 64 hops away.
% TCPWINDOW
Specifies the receive window size to advertise to peers;
that is, the limit on data buffered by tcp per connection.
Default is 4096.
With 16-bit Ethernet boards,
this value should probably be raised to 24576.
