ABSTRACT:Set Audit Criteria 
	The items in the "set" menu provide functions for selecting
	audit criteria for specific types of auditing.  They include
	the ability to set the System, User, and Object Level
	Audit Criteria on your machine.

	The tasks under this menu should be run prior to enabling
	auditing if the audit criteria has not been set after system
	startup.
