ABSTRACT:Disable Auditing
	The "disable" task allows you to disable auditing.  The
	audit buffer will be flushed to the audit log file and an audit 
	record will be written to indicate that auditing was turned off.  
	No additional audit records will be generated.

	Auditable events which are currently in progress when auditing
	is disabled will not have a record logged since they did not
	complete before auditing was disabled.

	PLEASE NOTE:  If auditing is disabled, there will not be a log
	of user actions to analyze if and when questionable security
	related events occur. If only selected events are recorded, data on
	other related events may not be available when needed.  If auditing
	is disabled during certain intervals, a sequence of events may
	not be able to be re-created due to the lack of audit data for
	such intervals.

Form.disable:disable:Disable Auditing
	Enter "yes" or "no".
