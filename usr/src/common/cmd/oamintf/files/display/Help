TITLE:
dispfstyptask:Help on Installed File System Types
        A list of the file system types installed on your system
        has been displayed. Note that some file system types do
        not support some of the familiar s5 file system features.
        For example, BFS file systems do not have file system
        labels, therefore, labelit(1M) is not available through
        OA&M for this file system type. Please consult your user
        documentation for more information concerning specific
        file system types.
