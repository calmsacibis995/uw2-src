# This is a sample configuration file.  It should be updated
# appropriately for the target configuration.  The first two fields,
# descr, can probably be set at build time.  They are mostly specific
# to a particular release of SNMP and to the target system.  The other
# two fields should be set when the product is installed on the target
# system.  They will be installation specific.
