This takes the machine-independent format in which the fonts are\ndistributed and compiles them into a machine readable format.\n\nTo use the X-Window system, the font binaries must be built.  This takes a\nfew minutes.  You can build them now, or do it at a later time by running\nthe shell script, /usr/X/adm/bldfonts.\n\nDo you want to build the font binaries now?
