The following files are currently being used by other packages on the system, and may be removed by the removal of this pre-SVR4 package:
If you choose to continue installation, it is possible that you will overwrite files which are part of another package that is already installed on the system.  If you want to assure that the files are not overwritten, answer 'n' to stop the installation process.
If you choose to continue removal, it is possible that you will remove files which are part of another package that is already installed on the system.  If you want to assure that the files are not removed, answer 'n' to stop the installation process.
The media being processed is in an old (pre-SVR4) format and it is not possible to verify that the inserted media belongs to the <%s> package.
If you choose to continue installation, it is possible that you will install the wrong package.  If you are sure the media being installed contains the package you wish to install, answer 'y' to continue the installation process.
The media being processed is in an old (pre-SVR4) format and appears to be part of the <%s> package.
The installation of older-style (pre-SVR4) packages is, in general, not as robust as installing standard packages.  Older packages may attempt things during installation which overwrite existing files or otherwise modify the system without your approval.  If you wish to allow installation of identified pre-SVR4 package, answer 'y' to continue the installation process.

If this package is not installed in a run-level which has been suggested, it is possible that the package may not install or operate properly.  If you wish to follow the run-level suggestions, answer 'n' to stop installation of the package.
\\nTo change states, execute\\n\\tshutdown -y -i%s -g0\\nafter exiting the installation process.  Please note that after changing states you may have to mount appropriate filesystem(s) in order to install this package.
Do you want to install these conflicting files
\\nThe following files are already installed on the system and are being used by another package:
If you choose to install conflicting files, the files listed above will be overwritten and/or have their access permissions changed.  If you choose not to install these files, installation will proceed but these specific files will not be installed.  Note that sane operation of the software being installed may require these files be installed; thus choosing to not to do so may cause inappropriate operation.  If you wish to stop installation of this package, enter 'q' to quit.
Do you want to install these files
\\nThe following files are being installed with setuid and/or setgid permissions or are overwriting files which are currently setuid/setgid:
The package being installed appears to contain processes which will have their effective user or group ids set upon execution.  History has shown that these types of processes can be a source of major security impact on your system.  If you choose not to install these files, installation will proceed but these specific files will not be installed.  Note that sane operation of the software being installed may require these files be installed; thus choosing to not to do so may cause inappropriate operation.  If you wish to stop installation of this package, enter 'q' to quit.
\\nThe installation of this package was previously terminated and installation was never successfully completed.
\\nThe removal of this package was terminated at some point in time, and package removal was only partially completed.
Installation of partially installed packages is normally allowable, but some packages providers may suggest that a partially installed package be completely removed before re-attempting installation.  Check the documentation provided with this package, and then answer 'y' if you feel it is advisable to continue the installation process.
It appears that there is not enough free space on your system in which to install this package.  It is possible that one or more filesystems are not properly mounted.  Neither installation of the package nor its operation can be guaranteed under these conditions.  If you choose to disregard this warning, enter 'y' to continue the installation process.
The package being installed has indicated a dependency on the existence (or non-existence) of another software package.  If this dependency is not met before continuing, the package may not install or operate properly.  If you wish to disregard this dependency, answer 'y' to continue the installation process.
\\nThis package contains scripts which may have a security impact and which will be executed during the process of installing this package.
During the installation of this package, certain scripts provided with the package will be executed. These scripts may modify or otherwise change your system without your knowledge.  If you are certain of the origin and trustworthiness of the package being installed, answer 'y' to continue the installation process.
Do you want to continue with the installation of this package
If you choose 'y', installation of this package will continue.  If you want to stop installation of this package, choose 'n'.
