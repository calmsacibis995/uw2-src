Novell TNVT220 Installation Information
________________________________________________________

1. Novell TNVT220 is a family member of Novell LAN WorkPlace.  Novell TNVT220 
   installation program installs a complete Novell TNVT220 package or upgrades
   your existing LAN WorkPlace v4.1. 
   If you have a LAN WorkPlace v4.1 installed, the installation program will 
   upgrade your existing LAN WorkPlace v4.1.  However, if you have LAN WorkPlace
   v4.1 installed on your system but do not have a search path currently set to 
   your LAN WorkPlace v4.1 bin directory, the installation program will assume 
   that you do not have LAN WorkPlace v4.1 already installed.  If you want to 
   upgrade, you must set your LAN WorkPlace v4.1 search path to the bin directory
   before the installation.

2. If you run setup from DOS prompt, be sure to run setup directly from the 
   floppy drive.  For example, if your floppy drive is A: and your current 
   drive is C:, do the following:

C:>A:
A:>setup
