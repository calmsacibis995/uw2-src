/*
 * The deferred interrupt stack and stack index.  The size of the deferred
 * interrupt stack is based on the following considerations:
 *
 *  (1)	At most one interrupt per service level can be deferred.  This
 *	is guaranteed because whenever an interrupt occurs, the system
 *	blocks all interrupts at the interrupt's service level, and the
 *	interrupts remain blocked until the service of the interrupt
 *	is completed.
 *
 *  (2)	Only interrupts whose interrupt priority level is at or below PLHI
 *	will be deferred.  This is guaranteed because the system always
 *	runs at PLHI or below, thus interrupts whose level is above PLHI
 *	will never be deferred.
 *
 *  (3)	The implication of (1) & (2) is that the maximum number of interrupts
 *	which will be deferred at any one time is equal to the number of
 *	priority levels from PL1 to PLHI, inclusive.  Since this implementation
 *	uses ordinal numbers to represent priority levels, we can say that the
 *	maximum number of deferred interrupts is PLHI - PL1 + 1, or just PLHI.
 *
 *  (4)	There is always a dummy value at the bottom of the deferred interrupt
 *	stack; see the initialization of picdeferred below.  Thus, the total
 *	size of picdeferred is PLHI + 1: PLHI for the maximum number of
 *	deferred interrupts, plus 1 for the dummy value.
