%% Miscellaneous Parameters
%C Miscellaneous Parameters
These tunable parameters are not part of any other category.
% MAXLINK
Specifies size of MAXLINK.
% PUTBUFSZ
Specifies the size of a circular buffer,
putbuf,
that is used to contain a copy of the last
PUTBUFSZ
characters written to the console
by the operating system.
The contents of
putbuf
can be viewed using the
crash(1M)
command
panic.
% SANITYCLK
Enable sanity clock on machines that support this feature.
%% Direct Memory Access (DMA) Parameters
%C Direct Memory Access (DMA) Parameters
These tunable parameters are associated with Direct Memory Access processing.
% PHYSTOKVMEM
The PHYSTOKVMEM tunable enables mapping mainstore memory (up to 256M)
for driver compatibility, for old drivers that used phystokv on data buffers.
With this tunable off, the first 1M of memory (including device memory)
is still mapped, to allow for drivers that used phystokv for
device memory or BIOS data.

Typically, the user need not change this tunable,
since it is automatically set for 
SRV4.2, UnixWare 1.0, and UnixWare 1.1
HBA (Host Bus Adapter) drivers that may need it set.
You may need to set it manually if you configure a non-HBA driver that 
uses phystokv.

When PHYSTOKVMEM is set to 1, it:

Allows drivers using the phystokv macro to access up to 256 MB
of main memory.

Disables the use of memory above the threshold given by MAXDMAPAGE
for kernel data and bss.
Normally, the kernel will try to locate itself above MAXDMAPAGE
(in an attempt to preserve the lower memory for more important uses).

Forces HBA drivers to be loaded into memory
below the threshold given by MAXDMAPAGE.
