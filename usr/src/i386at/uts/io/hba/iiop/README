cc_d1.pollq3 builds the polled version of the iiop driver that is included 
on the IHVHBA floppy.  cc_d1.q3 builds the interrupt driver version of 
the iiop driver.

The polled version must use iiop.cf/Space.c.poll when a loadable version 
of the iiop driver is built for including on the ihvhba floppy 
(etc/conf/mod.d/iiop).
