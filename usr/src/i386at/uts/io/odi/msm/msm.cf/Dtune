%C Open DataLink Interface Parameters
These tunable parameters are associated with the Open DataLink Interface.
% MSM_1KCHUNKS
Specifies the number of 1024 byte chunks
of memory pre-allocated for ODI (Open DataLink Interface) drivers.
Typically, each driver requires four of these chunks of memory.
This parameter is used only if ODI version 3.1 drivers
are installed in the system,
and the driver supports cards that do Bus Mastering DMA.
% MSM_2KCHUNKS
Specifies the number of 2048 byte chunks
of memory pre-allocated for ODI (Open DataLink Interface) drivers.
Typically, each driver requires 48 of these chunks of memory.
This parameter is used only if ODI version 3.1 drivers
are installed in the system,
and the driver supports cards that do Bus Mastering DMA.
% MSM_6KCHUNKS
Specifies the number of 6144 byte chunks
of memory pre-allocated for ODI (Open DataLink Interface) drivers.
Typically, each driver requires four of these chunks of memory.
This parameter is used only if ODI version 3.1 drivers
are installed in the system,
and the driver supports cards that do Bus Mastering DMA.
% MSM_10KCHUNKS
Specifies the number of 10240 byte chunks
of memory pre-allocated for ODI (Open DataLink Interface) drivers.
Typically, each driver requires two of these chunks of memory.
This parameter is used only if ODI version 3.1 drivers
are installed in the system,
and the driver supports cards that do Bus Mastering DMA.
% MSM_36KCHUNKS
Specifies the number of 36864 byte chunks
of memory pre-allocated for ODI (Open DataLink Interface) drivers.
Typically, each driver requires zero of these chunks of memory.
This parameter is used only if ODI version 3.1 drivers
are installed in the system,
and the driver supports cards that do Bus Mastering DMA.
