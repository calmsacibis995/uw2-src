REM	Introduction
REM	---------------
REM
REM	This file contains a list of EISA board names and Compaq product
REM	names to be used with the Compaq Insight Base System Agent.  
REM	While this file is not required for the Agent to operate, management 
REM	consoles (such as Compaq Insight Manager) depend on the information 
REM	provided by this file to provide an accurate view of the server.
REM	
REM	The information in this file is divided into three sections:
REM	
REM	1.  Section 1 contains a list of EISA system or expansion board
REM	    manufacturers.  This list is used to match EISA components
REM	    found in a system with the manufacturer.  If there is no entry 
REM	    for a particular EISA product (for instance, a new product), 
REM	    the Agent will only be able to identify the product's manufacturer
REM	    and EISA product ID.
REM	
REM	    NOTE: If the Agent does not find a manufacturer entry, it will
REM	          not search for more information about that product.
REM		  Therefore, any "BOARD" entry must have a corresponding
REM		  "COMPANY" entry.
REM	
REM	2.  Section 2 contains a list of EISA system or expansion board 
REM	    product names.  This list is used to identify specific ISA or 
REM	    EISA products installed in the server.  Once the Agent
REM	    has identified the product's manufacturer (from section 1), 
REM	    it will search this section looking for a product name whose 
REM	    EISA ID matches the one found in the server.
REM	
REM	3.  Section 3 contains a list of Compaq system names.  Using the 
REM	    EISA ID of the Compaq system board, and the Compaq processor 
REM	    board, the Agent will identify the Compaq system name for the 
REM	    NetWare server.  For non-EISA Compaq machines, a value 
REM	    retrieved from the PC's configuration memory is used to 
REM	    identify the machine.
REM	
REM	Instructions for adding your own entries to this file are
REM	given at the beginning of each section.  You can add comments
REM	to this file by using the "REM" statement at the beginning
REM	of any line.  The rest of the line will be treated as a comment
REM	(or REMark), and will not interfere with the processing of 
REM	the file.

REM
REM	Section 1: EISA Product Manufacturers
REM	----------------------------------------
REM 	
REM	The following is a list of EISA product manufacturers.  
REM	New entries may be added anywhere in the list, but it
REM	is recommended that you add entries alphabetically.
REM
REM	Each entry must be contained on a single line, and must 
REM	be in the following format:
REM
REM	COMPANY	xxx	<Company name>
REM
REM	Where "COMPANY" is the statement keyword, "xxx" is the
REM	three-character company ID, and "<Company Name>" is the
REM	name of the company, as it should appear on the management
REM	console.  The company ID can be found by reading the 
REM	three letters from the EISA configuration filename for that
REM	company's product.  For instance, the EISA configuration
REM	filename for a COMPAQ QVision 1024/E Video Controller is
REM	!CPQ3011.CFG.  Therefore, the company ID for Compaq is CPQ,
REM	and the entry would be:
REM
REM		COMPANY	CPQ	Compaq
REM	
REM
REM	NOTE:  Non-EISA products (8 or 16-bit ISA boards) can also
REM	       be assigned EISA product IDs.  The company ID for
REM	       non-EISA products is ISA.  The EISA product ID for
REM            for these products is in the format ISAxxxx, where
REM	       xxxx is a four digit number assigned to that product.

REM	Section 2: EISA Product Names
REM	-------------------------------
REM 	
REM	The following is a list of EISA products.  
REM	New entries may be added anywhere in the list, but it
REM	is recommended that you add entries only to the end of
REM	the list.
REM
REM	Each entry must be contained on a single line, and must 
REM	be in the following format:
REM
REM	BOARD	xxxxxx	<Product name>
REM
REM	Where "BOARD" is the statement keyword, "xxxxxxx" is the
REM	seven-character EISA product ID, and "<Product Name>" is the
REM	name of the product, as it should appear on the management
REM	console.  The EISA ID can be found by reading the EISA 
REM	Configuration filename for that product.  For instance, 
REM	the EISA configuration filename for a Novell NE3200
REM	Bus Master Ethernet board is !NVL0701.CFG.  Therefore, the
REM	product ID is NVL0701, and its entry would be:
REM	
REM	    BOARD  NVL0701  Novell NE3200 Bus Master Ethernet
REM	
REM	
REM	NOTE:  Non-EISA products (8 or 16-bit ISA boards) can also
REM	       be assigned EISA product IDs.  The company ID for
REM	       non-EISA products is ISA.  The EISA product ID for
REM            for these products is in the format ISAxxxx, where
REM	       xxxx is a four digit number assigned to that product.

REM	Section 3: Compaq System Names
REM	-------------------------------
REM 	
REM	The following is a list of Compaq System names.  
REM	While new entries may be added to the list, it is recommended
REM	that you obtain updates to this section from Compaq.
REM
REM	Each entry must be contained on a single line, and must 
REM	be in the following format:
REM
REM	For Compaq EISA-based machines:
REM
REM	  MACHINE	EISA	CPQxxxx	CPQyyyy	<Compaq system name>
REM
REM	  Where "MACHINE" is the statement keyword, "EISA" identifies
REM	  this as an EISA-based machine, the "CPQxxxx" is the
REM	  seven-character EISA product ID of the system board, 
REM	  the "CPQyyyy" is the seven-character EISA product ID
REM	  of the processor board, and "<Compaq system name>" is the
REM	  name of the system, as it should appear on the management
REM	  console.
REM
REM	  Since the system board determines the base name of the
REM	  server, such as "Compaq Systempro", additional entries
REM	  have been added with the processor board's EISA product
REM	  ID set to "CPQ????".  The Agent will interpret this 
REM	  entry as a wildcard, and will use it as a default name
REM	  for any machine which matches the system board ID.  This
REM	  default name will be used if no "MACHINE" entry matches
REM	  both the system board and processor board IDs.
REM	  

REM	For Compaq ISA-based machines:
REM
REM	  MACHINE	ISA	xx	<Compaq system name>
REM
REM	  Where "MACHINE" is the statement keyword, "ISA" identifies
REM	  this as an ISA-based machine, the "xx" is the hexadecimal
REM	  ID of the system board stored in configuration memory,
REM	  and "<Compaq system name>" is the name of the system, as 
REM	  it should appear on the management console.
