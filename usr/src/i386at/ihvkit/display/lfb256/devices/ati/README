To generate a Makefile use:
	/usr/X/bin/imake -DTOPDIR=. -DCURDIR=. -I/usr/X/lib/config
this will use the header files and libraries provided with this package, don't
use -DUseInstalled, as indicated in Imakefile, since that will try to use the
existing headers and libraries, which might not work if you have an older
version of the X server.  When you are ready to do a make you must set
DISPLIBREV, e.g.:
	make DISPLIBREV=1
