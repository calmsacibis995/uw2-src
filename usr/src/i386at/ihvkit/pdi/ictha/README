The current directory contains all of the files necessary to natively build
and install a non-SCSI tape driver.  Observe the following precautions 
before building and installing the driver:

1) Read the commented section of hba.h and initialize sdi.h to the appropriate
   value:

	#define PDI_VERSION	1  for UNIXWARE 1.1

	The hba.h available with UnixWare-2.0 has the correct value for
	PDI_VERSION.


2) Make sure that the hardware is configured for the corret system parameter
   values: IRQ, I/O, addr, etc as provided in ictha.cf/System.

3a) If you are using a UNIXWARE-1.1 system, observe the following rules:

   Unconfigure the ict driver by modifying /etc/conf/sdevice.d/ict: 

	change the Y to a N.

   Modify the dcd driver entry that uses the interrupt vector 5:

   	change the Y to a N. 

   Rebuild the kernel and reboot the system.

   On the new kernel do the following:

	The current directory contains a separate set of configuration 
	files to be used when compiling this driver on a 1.1 platform.  
	Save the configuration files under ictha.cf (2.0 version of config 
	files) and replace them with the 1.1 versions available under 
	ictha_1.1.cf

   	(a) Execute make -f ictha.mk to build and install the driver.

   	(b) Add an entry for ictha to /etc/loadmods.

		echo "6:1:ictha:ictha" >> /etc/loadmods

	(d) idbuild -B && init 6.

3b) If you are using a UnixWare 2.0 based system:

	(a) Save a copy of ictha.h (/usr/include/sys).
	(b) Execute make -f ictha.mk to build and install the driver.
	(c) idbuild -B && init 6.


4) If no entries for the ictha driver are available in /etc/loadmods, then add 
the following entry to the /etc/loadmods file

	6:1:ictha:ictha
